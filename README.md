GMAIL_PASSWORD=<Your App Password>
```

Replace the placeholders (`<...>`) with your actual values:

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Obtain this from OpenAI by signing up and generating an API key.
- **GMAIL_USER**: This is the Gmail address you will use to send emails.
- **GMAIL_PASSWORD**: This is a generated app password. Follow the instructions below to create one.
